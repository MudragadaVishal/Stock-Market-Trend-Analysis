# 📈 Stock Market Trend Analysis using LSTM

## 🔍 Overview
This project is a **stock market trend analysis and prediction system** developed as a **mini project under the Minor in Artificial Intelligence program at IIT Ropar**. The objective is to analyze historical stock market data and predict future trends using **Deep Learning techniques**, specifically **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.

LSTM models are highly effective for time-series data as they capture long-term dependencies, making them suitable for financial market prediction tasks.
